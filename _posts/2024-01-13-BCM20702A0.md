I am currently utilizing a Dell E6330 Latitude Laptop, which despite its age, serves my needs adequately. This laptop was an economical choice as it was obtained at no cost. Furthermore, its robust construction makes it a reliable tool for my current requirements, which do not demand high processing power.

However, I encountered a challenge when transitioning from Debian Linux to Windows 10 LTSC IOT. The issue pertains to the installation of the correct Bluetooth driver. Windows does not automatically install the appropriate driver, necessitating some investigation to identify the correct one.

If you are using a Windows installation and upon checking the Device Manager, you find ‘BCM20702A0’ displayed, this indicates the need for a specific driver. This driver can be found at the following location:  - https://ftp.hp.com/pub/softpaq/sp75001-75500/sp75330.exe.
