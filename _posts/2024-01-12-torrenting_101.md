Torrenting is a way of sharing files over the internet using the BitTorrent protocol. It allows you to download large files from multiple sources at once, without relying on a central server. However, torrenting also has some legal and ethical issues, depending on the content you are downloading and sharing. In this blog post, I will explain what torrenting is, how it works, and how to do it safely and efficiently.

## Is torrenting illegal?

Torrenting itself is not illegal, as it is just a method of transferring data from one computer to another. However, the legality of torrenting depends on the content you are downloading and sharing. If the content is protected by copyright, such as movies, music, games, etc., then torrenting it is illegal and can get you in trouble with the law.

On the other hand, if the content is free and legal, such as Linux ISOs, open-source software, public domain books, etc., then torrenting it is perfectly fine and even encouraged. Torrenting can be a fast and efficient way of distributing large files to many users.

## What are some torrenting terms?

To understand how torrenting works, you need to know some basic terms:

- **Tracker**: A server that keeps track of the peers in a torrent swarm (the group of users who are downloading and uploading the same file). The tracker helps the peers to find each other and exchange data.
- **Peer**: A user who has downloaded some parts of the file and is still downloading and uploading. Peers can get data from other peers or from seeders.
- **Seeder**: A user who has downloaded the entire file and is sharing it with others. Seeders are essential for the health and speed of the torrent swarm, as they provide the source of the data.
- **Leecher**: A user who downloads the file but does not share it back with the swarm. Leechers are frowned upon in the torrent community, as they reduce the availability and speed of the file.
- **.torrent file**: A small file that contains the metadata of the torrent, such as the name, size, hash, tracker, etc. You need a .torrent file to start downloading a torrent.
- **Magnet link**: A string of characters that contains the same information as a .torrent file, but in a more compact form. You can use a magnet link to download a torrent without needing a .torrent file.
- **Public tracker**: A tracker that is open to anyone and does not require registration or login. Public trackers are easy to use, but they can be risky, as they may contain malicious or illegal files, and expose you to monitoring and legal actions.
- **Private tracker**: A tracker that is closed to the public and requires an invitation, registration, and login. Private trackers are more secure, as they have higher quality and legal files, and protect your privacy and anonymity. However, they are harder to access, and often have strict rules and requirements, such as maintaining a certain ratio of upload and download.

## What are some torrenting tools?

To download torrents, you will need a torrent client, which is a software that handles the communication and data transfer between the peers and the tracker. There are many torrent clients available, but some of the most popular ones are:

- **Deluge**: A lightweight and cross-platform client that supports many features and plugins. You can download it from [Deluge](https://dev.deluge-torrent.org/wiki/Download).
- **qBittorrent**: A free and open-source client that aims to be a good alternative to uTorrent, without ads or spyware. You can download it from [qBittorrent](https://www.qbittorrent.org/download).
- **Transmission**: A simple and easy-to-use client that is the default client for many Linux distributions. You can download it from [Transmission](https://transmissionbt.com/download.html).

Some torrent clients have a desktop application and a web UI, which means you can access and control them from your web browser. To use the web UI, you need to enable it from the settings of your torrent client, and then enter the IP address and port of your client in your browser. For example, if your client is running on your local machine with the default port, you can access the web UI by typing `http://localhost:8080` in your browser.

## How to download torrents?

To download torrents, you need to follow these steps:

1. Find a torrent file or a magnet link from a torrent site or a search engine. Some examples of public torrent sites are [1337x](https://1337x.to/), [TorrentGalaxy](https://torrentgalaxy.to/) and although not as trustworthy these days [ThePirateBay](https://thepiratebay.org). Some examples of private torrent sites are [IPTorrents], [PassThePopcorn], and [Bibliotik]. Make sure the torrent is legal and safe, and check the comments and ratings for feedback.
2. Open the torrent file or the magnet link with your torrent client. You can do this by double-clicking the file, or copying and pasting the link in your client. You will see a window where you can choose the location and the files you want to download.
3. Start the download and wait for it to finish. You will see the progress, speed, and status of your download in your client. You can also adjust the settings, such as the bandwidth limit, the priority, and the queue.
4. After the download is complete, you can open and enjoy the file. However, you should also seed the file for a while, to help other users who are downloading it. You can see the ratio of your upload and download in your client, and aim for a ratio of at least 1 (meaning you have uploaded the same amount of data as you have downloaded).

## VPN vs Seedbox

A VPN and a seedbox are two different tools that can help you with torrenting, which is a way of sharing files over the internet using the BitTorrent protocol.

A VPN, or virtual private network, is a service that encrypts and routes your internet traffic through a remote server, hiding your IP address and location from anyone who might be monitoring your online activity. A VPN can protect your privacy and security, as well as help you access geo-restricted or censored content. You can use a VPN for any online activity, not just torrenting.

A seedbox, on the other hand, is a dedicated server that hosts a torrent client and downloads and uploads torrent files for you. A seedbox can provide you with high-speed and unlimited bandwidth, as well as keep your torrenting activity separate from your personal device and network. A seedbox is mainly used for torrenting, and you need to transfer the downloaded files from the seedbox to your device to access them.

When looking for a VPN provider it's best to choose one that doesn't keep logs.  [PrivateInternetAccess](https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/) is a well known provider that doesn't keep logs or any payment information.

As far as a Seedbox [UltraCC](https://ultra.cc/) is a cheap and private seedbox provider.  They even offer full media server suite setup with a few button clicks.

## Some intricacies

Ask Tracker for more peers or Force Reannounce -

What does the numbers next to the brackets mean under Seeds and Peers?

_Seeds vs Peers Number Meanings_

The numbers under seeds and peers indicate the availability and connectivity of the torrent file you are downloading or uploading. Seeds are users who have the complete file and are sharing it with others, while peers are users who have some parts of the file and are still downloading and uploading.

The number outside the brackets is the number of seeds or peers you are currently connected to, while the number inside the brackets is the total number of seeds or peers available in the swarm (the group of users who are downloading and uploading the same file).

For example, if you see something like 4 (8) seeds and 6 (12) peers, it means that you are connected to 4 out of 8 seeds and 6 out of 12 peers in the swarm1.

The more seeds and peers there are in the swarm, the faster the download speed will be. It is considered good etiquette to seed back the file after you finish downloading it, so that other users can benefit from your upload.
